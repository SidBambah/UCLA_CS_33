B.
	Eval passes %rdi into process. This register holds the address at
	%rsp + 64, which is actually the start of the structure r.
C.
	The rsp pointer is decremented by 8 to hold the return location. Thus,
	the function process can see element s.a[0] at rsp + 8, s.a[1] at rsp + 16,
	and s.p at rsp + 24. This is because all longs and pointers to longs take up
	8 bytes of space.
D.
	The function process sets the fields of r by saving the accessed values into 
	registers and these are copied into rdi at various offsets corresponding to 
	the locations of the member variables.

F.
	Structures are both passed and returned from functions in
	the form of addresses in memory. The member variables of the structure
	are accessed by ofsetting the address that is passed into the function
	to the offset of the required member variable.
