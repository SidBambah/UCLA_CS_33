A.
	The sizeof operator always returns a value of type size_t. This type is
	defined to be an unsigned type. The command maxbytes - sizeof(val) will 
	undergo unsigned arithmetic and will never be less than zero. Thus, this
	conditional will always be true and the value will always be written into
	the buffer.

B.
	This conditional can be rewritten with the assumption that maxbytes will always
	be greater than zero. Thus, when it is cast to unsigned, the two's complement does
	not change.
	(maxbytes >= sizeof(val))
