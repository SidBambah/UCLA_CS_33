	A. Unsafe. This trajectory becomes unsafe as soon as it goes to L1 after H1.
	B. Safe. This trajectory is safe, but runs on the edge of the unsafe region between 
		S1 and L2.
	C. Unsafe. This trajector goes into the unsafe region after it passes H2 and goes to
		L2

	In order for a function to be reentrant it must not reference any shared data when it is
	called by multiple threads. Many of the Rio functions are passed a buffer and local stack variables; 
	as long as this buffer is not shared between the functions they are considered to be implicitly reenterant.
	However, if the buffer is shared between the functions they will automatically become non reentrant.
